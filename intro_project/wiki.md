- _Irrotational flow_: a flow in which each element of the moving fluid undergoes no net rotation with respect to a chosen coordinate axes from one instant to other
- _Inviscid_: having no or negligible viscosity
- _Airfoil camber_: the asymmetry between the two acting surfaces of an airfoil, with the top surface of a wing commonly being more convex. An airfoil that is not cambered is called a symmetric airfoil
- _Potential flow_: an idealized model of fluid flow that occurs in the case of incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational flow
- _Freestream_: the air far upstream of an aerodynamic body, that is, before the body has a chance to deflect, slow down or compress the air
- _Angle of attack_: the angle at which the chord of an aircraft's wing meets the relative wind
- _Chord_: a straight line from the leading edge to the trailing edge
- _Drag coefficient_: equal to the drag D divided by density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A. It expresses the ratio of the drag force to the force produced by the dynamic pressure times the area
- _Lift coefficient_: relates the lift generated by a lifting body to the fluid density around the body, the fluid velocity and an associated reference area
- _Airfoil polar_: represent the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil
- _Lift curve slope_: measure of how rapidly the wing generates lift with change in AOA
- _Airfoil thickness_: the greatest distance between the upper and the lower surfaces of an airfoil
- _Reynold's number_: helps predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. At low Reynolds numbers, flows tend to be dominated by laminar (sheet-like) flow, while at high Reynolds numbers flows tend to be turbulent
- _Mach number_: ratio of the speed of a body to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium
