# 497R-project

## Description

This repository holds the accumulated projects from ME EN 497R at Brigham Young University. The different directories within this repository hold those projects.

### _Projects_

- [Leapfrogging vortex rings](./intro_project):
  - this project looks at the the phenomenon of leapfrogging vortex rings. Within is a program that models that phenomenon on a 2-dimensional scale and a report that covers how it was accomplished and what the findings were
- [Project 1](./project_1):
  - in this project, I evaluated airfoils using the Xfoil.jl library. The explorations made in this project were as follows:
    - the effect of airfoil angle of attack on airfoil lift, drag, and moment
    - how data collected from Xfoil compares to experimental data
    - the effect of Reynolds number on airfoil lift, drag, and moment
    - the effect of airfoil thickness and camber on airfoil lift to drag ratio and lift curve slope behavior
- [Project 2](./project_2):
  - in this project, I evaluated airframes using the VortexLattice.jl library. The explorations made in this project were as follows:
    - the effects of wing aspect ratio vs wing efficiency
    - the effects of tail volume ratio on the stability derivatives of an airframe
    - the effects on angle of attack on the lift coefficient and the limitations of the VLM
- [Project 3](./project_3):
  - in this project, I designed an airframe that:
    - can lift 0.5 kilograms with a wingspan no greater than 1.5 meters
    - is statically and dynamically stable
    - maximizes or minimizes the objective function of my choosing
