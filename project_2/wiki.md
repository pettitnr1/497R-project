- _Sweep_: the angle at which the wing is translated backwards (or occasionally forwards) relative to the root chord of the wing
- _Aspect Ratio_: aspect ratio of a wing is the ratio of its span to its mean chord. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio
- _Wake Vortex_: a lifting wing has higher pressure on the bottom surface as compared to the top, and so fluid will circulate around the tips
- _Downwash_: can be viewed more fundamentally as a consequence of Newton’s third law. If a body is producing lift, colloquially we might say that means that the air is pushing the body up. Thus, by Newton’s third law, the body must be pushing the air downward. Thus, any three-dimensional lifting body will leave behind a wake of downward moving air
- _Induced Drag/Vortex Drag_: major consequence of this downwash, is that energy is left behind in the wake. Or in other words, the wing produces drag
- _Vortex Filament_: an arbitrary vortex line segment
- _Vortex Lattice Method_: an extension of thin airfoil theory into three dimensions
- _Inviscid Span Efficiency_:  the inviscid span efficiency could be considered a measure of how close the lift distribution is to elliptic. All planar distributions will have efficiency less than or equal to 1. A nonplanar lift distribution (e.g., adding winglets) can increase the inviscid span efficiency above 1
- _Tail Volume Ratio_: relates the shape of the tail to the wing
- _Stability Derivatives_: measures of how particular forces and moments on an aircraft change as other parameters related to stability change
